      `Residential Real Estate`,
      `Our practice in this area is limited to the purchase, sale and/or refinancing of residential real estate.
      The purchase of a home is often one of the largest single transactions one will make in their lifetime. For this reason, one must consider the services of an experienced real estate attorney. We will help the process go smoothly by asking relevant questions, educating you on your transaction and protecting your interests and ensuring that the transaction follows real estate rules and regulations.`,
      `Scams and Fraud`,
      `There are new scams every day involving the sale and refinancing of real estate. They are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Some red flags may be overlooked when signing contracts. Certain patterns in a real estate transaction may indicate to a keen observer that there is a problem. Some fact patterns or gaps in information could mean that the client or the real estate agents may be victims of real estate fraud. Having an experienced attorney closing your deal adds a second layer of scrutiny.  If you retain a real estate attorney early enough, they may be able to help mitigate these and other risks in buying a home.`,
